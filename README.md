GeminiDesk is more than a wrapper. It's a command center, loaded with powerful, exclusive features that will make you wonder how you ever lived without them.

### 🧠 Advanced AI Features

*   **🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support:** Connect your AI to your local world. Run local tools, access files, and build powerful workflows with built-in MCP support. The app includes an automatic **"Do it for me"** setup to get your local proxy server running in seconds.
*   **🗓️ Deep Research Automation & Scheduler:** Set it and forget it. Schedule complex research tasks to run automatically! Set a day, time, and a detailed prompt. GeminiDesk will wake up, launch, switch to the Pro model, execute your "Deep Research" query, and notify you when done.
*   **📝 Prompt Manager:** Never type the same context twice. Create, edit, and manage a library of custom prompts. **Set a "Default Prompt"** to be automatically sent every time you start a new chat—perfect for setting up persistent personas or coding rules.
*   **🤖 Dual Modes:** Start your session your way. Choose between the classic **Gemini** chat interface for streamlined conversations or the powerful **AI Studio** for advanced prompt engineering and API development.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security

*   **🔒 Invisibility Mode:** Need privacy during meetings? Activate Invisibility Mode to hide the GeminiDesk window from screen sharing applications (like Zoom, Teams, Discord) and screen recording tools.
*   **🌐 Proxy Support:** Behind a corporate firewall or need to route your traffic? Configure HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 proxies directly within the app settings.

### ⚡ Productivity & Workflow

*   **📸 Smart Screenshots:**
    *   **Select Area:** Instantly snip any part of your screen (`Ctrl+Alt+S`).
    *   **Auto Full-Screen:** Toggle the option to capture the entire screen instantly for faster workflow.
    *   The image is beamed directly into your chat, ready for analysis.
*   **📤 Ultimate Export Suite:**
    *   **PDF:** Beautifully formatted with **KaTeX** for math, **Highlight.js** for code, and full **RTL (Right-to-Left)** support for Hebrew/Arabic.
    *   **Markdown:** Direct export to `.md` files.
*   **🖼️ Smart Canvas Mode:** The app window automatically expands to a larger "Canvas" size when Gemini enters its immersive panel, perfect for deep dives and coding tasks.

### 🎨 Customization & Accessibility

*   **🔊 Smart Audio Feedback:** Know the second your AI has finished its thought. GeminiDesk plays a subtle, satisfying sound upon completion. Choose from multiple sound options in settings.
*   **🌍 Full Internationalization:** The entire app interface is localized into over 20 languages, with RTL support built into the core.
*   **⚡️ Instant Model Switching:** Use hotkeys (`Alt+F`, `Alt+P`) to instantly fire up a new chat with either the **Flash** or **Pro** model.
*   **🎤 Voice Assistant:** Activate the microphone instantly with a shortcut to talk to Gemini hands-free.
